## ENS04-MED : Ensemble simulation of the Mediterranean
**Key features**: full Mediterranean basin, 1/12° resolution, 75 levels, 30 ensemble members, 41 years (1979-2020).

ENS04-MED is a 30-member ensemble of ocean simulations covering the entire Mediterranean Sea. It has been specifically designed to investigate the respective contributions of atmospheric forcing and internal ocean dynamics to the variability of the basin's circulation. The ensemble provides a unique resource for studying the predictability limits of ocean dynamics, the emergence of intrinsic (chaotic) variability, and the regional response of mesoscale processes to identical external forcing.
Model configuration

This work uses the NEMOMED12 [(Beuvier et al., 2012a)](https://www.umrcnrm.fr/IMG/pdf/doc_nemo_med12.pdf) regional configuration of the NEMO ocean model, adapted for the Mediterranean Sea. The simulation domain spans the entire basin at a horizontal resolution of 1/12° (~6–7 km), with 75 vertical levels. The full simulations then ran continuously from 1 January 1979 to 30 december 2020, covering a total of 41 years. The parameterization of the model physics has been kept the same as in the original model in all ensemble members.

**Initialization:** each of the 30 ensemble members was initialized from a distinct ocean state generated by perturbing the biharmonic viscosity coefficient during a six-month spin-up phase.

**Surface forcing:** the surface atmospheric forcing (ALDERA3, Hamon et al. 2016) is kept identical across members after the spin-up phase, ensuring that the ensemble divergence results solely from internal dynamics.
