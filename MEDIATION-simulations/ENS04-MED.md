This ensemble simulation was run by Brankart in order to investigate ...

## Model setup

This work uses the NEMO ocean model, with a stochastic .... The 50 year simulation was run on a  km domain, with a  horizontal resolution, ... 
To fit the study's needs, the model sources were modified (see [ABL_response_to_SST_front](../../MEDIATION-tools/ABL_response_to_SST_front) toolbox for further details).
