# MESO-NH_S1 : Simulation output for "Atmosphere Response to an Oceanic Sub-mesoscale SST Front: A Coherent Structure Analysis" ([Jacquet et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JD042312))

This large-eddy simulation (LES) was run by Jacquet et al. (2025) in order to investigate an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow due to a submesoscale sea-surface temperature (SST) front.

## Model setup

This work uses the MESO-NH (mesoscale non-hydrostatic) atmosphere model, in a LES (large-eddy simulation) configuration. The 3-hour simulation was run on a 38.4x8x2 km domain, with a 50m horizontal resolution, heterogeneous vertical levels, and a 1s timestep. To fit the study's needs, the model sources were modified (see [ABL_response_to_SST_front](../../MEDIATION-tools/ABL_response_to_SST_front) toolbox for further details).
