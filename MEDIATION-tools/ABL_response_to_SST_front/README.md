# ABL_response_to_SST_front (Hugo Jacquet)

This set of tools was developed by [Jaquet et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JD042312), with the aim to assess sea surface / atmosphere exchanges above submesoscale (less than 10 km) using a large eddy simulation. The goal was to :

* Modify the MESO-NH model for the experiment's needs (Fortran),
* Visualize data from MESO-NH_S1 outputs (Python).
