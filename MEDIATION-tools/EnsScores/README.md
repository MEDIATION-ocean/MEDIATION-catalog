# EnsScores [(Brankart, 2021)](https://github.com/brankart/ensdam/blob/master/doc/ensscores.pdf)

The EnsScores tool set was developed by Jean-Michel Brankart, in order to compute probabilistic assessment scores for ensemble simulations. These scores help evaluating the resolution and reliability of ensemble simulations that are used in the MEDIATION project.
The full tool set is available on [Jean-Michel Brankart's git repository](https://github.com/brankart/ensdam/tree/master/src/EnsScores). A detailed user guide for EnsScores tools is also available [on the same repository](https://github.com/brankart/ensdam/blob/master/doc/ensscores.pdf).
